# ReadMe

This repo contains the files that implemented the experiments and the data used in the paper 'Neural networks for open and closed literature based discovery' by Gamal Crichton, Simon Baker, Yufan Guo and Anna Korhonen.

The shell file contains the steps to automate the experiments. The .py files are used in the batch script.

The LINE folder contains implementations of the LINE algorithm obtained freely on the internet.

The *Models* folder contains the files for the models used. The data files used were too large for Github's file size limit. They can be found at:
